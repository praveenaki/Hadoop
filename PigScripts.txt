Input Data Set: {(host:chararray,delay:long)}

Problem: Find top 100 delays on each host

Hint: Use Nested Foreach

a = LOAD 'Data Set';

grpd = order a by host; //grpd has group:chararray(server) , a:databag

top100 = foreach grpd{ //each line in grpd relation has a inner relation named a (subset of a which have same server)
	sorted = order a by delay desc;
	limited = limit sorted 100;
	generate group, limited;
};

dump top100;
